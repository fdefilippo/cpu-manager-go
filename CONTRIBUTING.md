- Check issues labeled [`help wanted`](https://github.com/fdefilippo/cpu-manager-go/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
- Read existing documentation to understand the codebase

### Questions?

- Open an issue for questions
- Check existing issues and discussions
- Read the [README](README.md) and [documentation](docs/)

---

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later
- Git
- Linux system with cgroups v2 support (for testing)
- Root access or appropriate capabilities (for integration tests)

### Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub

# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cpu-manager-go.git
cd cpu-manager-go

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/fdefilippo/cpu-manager-go.git
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
go mod download
go mod verify
```

### Build Locally

```bash
make build
```

### Run Tests

```bash
make test
```

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:

```
feature/add-new-metric
fix/cgroup-permission-error
docs/update-readme
refactor/improve-error-handling
```

### Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat: add user memory metrics
fix: resolve cgroup permission issue
docs: update installation instructions
test: add unit tests for config package
refactor: improve error handling in collector
```

**Format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation
- `test`: Tests
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `chore`: Maintenance
- `perf`: Performance improvement

### Code Style

- Follow Go best practices
- Run `go fmt` before committing
- Run `go vet` to catch issues
- Keep functions focused and small
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use meaningful variable names

### Adding Metrics

When adding new Prometheus metrics:

1. Add metric to `metrics/prometheus.go`
2. Register in `registerMetrics()`
3. Update in `UpdateMetrics()` or `UpdateUserMetrics()`
4. Update documentation in `docs/`
5. Add to Grafana dashboard
6. Update man page

---

## Testing

### Unit Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
go test -v ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -v -cover ./...

# Run specific package tests
go test -v ./config/...
go test -v ./metrics/...
```

### Integration Tests

```bash
# Requires root and cgroups v2
sudo make test-integration
```

### Manual Testing

1. Build the binary:
   ```bash
   go build -o cpu-manager-go
   ```

2. Create a test configuration:
   ```bash
   cp config/cpu-manager.conf.example /etc/cpu-manager.conf
   ```

3. Run in debug mode:
   ```bash
   sudo ./cpu-manager-go --config /etc/cpu-manager.conf --log-level DEBUG
   ```

4. Check metrics:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:9101/metrics
   ```

### Test Coverage

Aim for >80% coverage in new code:

```bash
# Generate coverage report
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```
